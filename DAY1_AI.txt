BIT CHATBOT
                                        BITRA Chatbot – Rule-Based AI Chatbot

BITRA is an AI-powered chatbot used by Bannari Amman Institute of Technology to assist website visitors.
It is designed to answer common questions like admissions, courses, fees, hostel, and contact details.
The chatbot uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand user queries in simple English.
It works mainly as a retrieval-based chatbot, giving answers from a predefined knowledge database.
The system performs intent detection, identifying what the user is asking (e.g., admission, course, department).
It has a knowledge base containing college-related information such as programs, departments, and facilities.
The chatbot follows a fixed workflow: user → NLP → intent classification → answer selection → response.
It improves website navigation by delivering quick answers instead of users searching manually.
BITRA provides 24/7 instant support, reducing workload for the administrative helpdesk.
The chatbot enhances student admission support, giving fast guidance to prospective students.
It uses rule-based templates for answers to maintain accuracy and avoid confusion.
The system is easy to use, with a simple chat window on the BIT website.
BITRA does not use advanced generative AI like ChatGPT; it relies on matching questions to fixed answers.
The chatbot has limitations — it cannot handle complex or unexpected queries effectively.
Overall, the chatbot improves communication by offering quick, reliable, and automated responses on the BIT website.
