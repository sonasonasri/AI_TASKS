POLYNOMIAL EQUATION IN LINEAR REGRESSION PROBLEM

from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures
import numpy as np
# sample data
X = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]).reshape(-1, 1)
y = np.array([2, 5, 10, 17, 26])
# polynomial features of degree 2
poly = PolynomialFeatures(degree=2)
X_poly = poly.fit_transform(X)
# model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_poly, y)
print("Coefficients:", model.coef_)
print("Intercept:", model.intercept_)

Models curved relationships between x and y.
Equation: y=b0+b1x+b2x2+...+bnxn.
Still called linear regression (linear in coefficients).
Captures non-linear trends.
Useful for U-shape, S-shape, or curved data.
Adds powers of features (𝑥2,𝑥3x2,x3, etc.).
Gives better fit than straight-line regression.
Degree too low → underfitting.
Degree too high → overfitting.
Examples: house price vs size, plant growth, speed vs distance.
Graph: straight line → linear, curve → polynomial.
Uses least squares to minimize error.
Coefficients show contribution of each power.
Easy to implement in Python with sklearn.
Key idea: simple way to fit non-linear data without complex models.
